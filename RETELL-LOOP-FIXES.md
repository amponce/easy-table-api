# Retell AI Loop Prevention Fixes

## Problem Analysis
The "Ending the conversation early as there might be a loop" error occurs when:
1. Tools return empty/unhelpful responses repeatedly
2. AI gets stuck asking the same questions
3. Date/time handling issues cause consistent failures
4. Missing proper conversation flow control

## Key Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Date Handling Improvements**
- ✅ Convert "tonight"/"today" to actual dates
- ✅ Limit future bookings to 60 days max
- ✅ Auto-adjust dates that are too far in future
- ✅ Handle relative date requests properly

### 2. **Tool Response Enhancements**
- ✅ Always provide helpful `alternatives` even when `available: false`
- ✅ Include meaningful error messages
- ✅ Suggest alternative dates when restaurant is closed
- ✅ Provide fallback options (phone number, website)

### 3. **Loop Prevention Mechanisms**
- ✅ Conversation turn limit (20 turns max)
- ✅ Question repetition tracking (3 attempts max per question)
- ✅ Graceful transfer to human agents when stuck
- ✅ Clear exit conditions and conversation endings

### 4. **Error Handling**
- ✅ Robust validation for all tool inputs
- ✅ Meaningful error responses instead of empty data
- ✅ Timeout handling for API calls
- ✅ Fallback responses for system errors

## Retell AI Configuration Recommendations

### Tool Configuration
Make sure your Retell tools are configured with these exact URLs:

**Get Availability Tool:**
- URL: `https://easy-table-api.onrender.com/api/tools/get_availability`
- Method: POST
- Response Variables:
  - `$.available` (boolean)
  - `$.alternatives` (array)
  - `$.message` (string, optional)

**Create Booking Tool:**
- URL: `https://easy-table-api.onrender.com/api/tools/create_booking`
- Method: POST
- Response Variables:
  - `$.status` (number)
  - `$.confirmation` (string)
  - `$.error` (string, optional)

### Prompt Improvements
Add these guidelines to your Retell AI prompt:

```
CONVERSATION FLOW RULES:
1. If availability check fails 2+ times, offer to transfer to human agent
2. If customer says "tonight" or "today", use current date
3. If no availability found, always suggest alternative dates/times
4. After 3 failed attempts to get any information, offer human transfer
5. End conversation after successful booking confirmation
6. If tools return errors, provide phone number: (555) 123-4567

LOOP PREVENTION:
- Don't ask the same question more than 3 times
- If stuck, say: "Let me transfer you to our reservation team"
- Always acknowledge customer responses before asking follow-ups
- Provide alternatives when primary request fails
```

### Response Variable Mapping
Ensure your Retell configuration maps these variables correctly:

```json
{
  "get_availability": {
    "available": "$.available",
    "alternatives": "$.alternatives",
    "message": "$.message"
  },
  "create_booking": {
    "status": "$.status", 
    "confirmation": "$.confirmation",
    "error": "$.error"
  }
}
```

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying, test these scenarios:

- [ ] Request for "tonight" - should use current date
- [ ] Request for far future date - should suggest closer date
- [ ] No availability scenarios - should provide alternatives
- [ ] Invalid booking data - should return clear error
- [ ] System errors - should offer phone number fallback
- [ ] Successful booking - should end conversation

## Monitoring

Watch for these patterns in your logs:
- Multiple identical tool calls
- Empty alternatives arrays
- dayStatus: false responses
- Repeated question patterns
- Long conversation transcripts (>15 turns)

## Emergency Fallbacks

If loops still occur:
1. Add conversation turn counter to prompt
2. Set hard limit: "After 10 exchanges, transfer to human"
3. Add random variation to responses
4. Implement circuit breaker pattern in tools
